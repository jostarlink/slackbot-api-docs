# Attachments
 Message attachments are one of the greatest features of Slack API. They let you enrich your messages with beautiful formats.
 
 As fun as they might seem, writing attachment objects is not really that easy, sometimes the attachments become a large object which is hard to maintain.
 
 That's why we have an Attachment class which helps you create attachment objects.
